<li><p><strong>Q: What is the difference between hardware and
software?</strong><br/></p><details><summary><strong>Show
Answer</strong></summary> <p><strong>Hardware</strong>
refers to the physical components of a computer (CPU, memory, keyboard,
etc.), whereas <strong>software</strong> refers to the programs and
instructions that run on the hardware (applications, operating system,
code). Hardware is tangible; software is intangible logic that tells the
hardware what to do.</p> </details></li>
<li><p><strong>Q: Why do computers use binary (0s and 1s) to represent
data?</strong><br/></p><details><summary><strong>Show
Answer</strong></summary> <p>Computers use binary
because their electronic circuits have two distinct states (on/off,
represented by 1/0). Using binary is a reliable way for digital circuits
to store and manipulate all kinds of information. Any data (numbers,
letters, images, etc.) can be encoded in binary form for the computer to
process.</p> </details></li>
<li><p><strong>Q: What are the basic steps to write and run a Java
program?</strong><br/></p><details><summary><strong>Show
Answer</strong></summary> <p>First, you write the
program's source code in a <code>.java</code> file using a text editor
or IDE. Next, you <strong>compile</strong> the source code using the
Java compiler (<code>javac</code>), which checks for errors and
translates the code into Java <strong>bytecode</strong> (a
<code>.class</code> file). If compilation succeeds, you then
<strong>run</strong> the program by launching the Java interpreter
(<code>java</code>), which executes the bytecode on the Java Virtual
Machine, producing the program's output.</p>

Computers, Programs, and Why We Need
Programming</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"><p><br/>
Computers are everywhere - in our phones, laptops, cars, and even
kitchen appliances. But a computer on its own is just machinery. What
actually makes a computer useful is a <strong>program</strong>: a set of
instructions telling the hardware what to do. A computer program can be
anything from a simple calculator app to a complex video game. By
writing programs, we <em>control</em> the computer's behavior and solve
problems or perform tasks automatically. This is why programming is so
powerful: it allows us to harness the speed and accuracy of computers to
do work for us.</p></div></details><details class="nested-toggle" style="margin-top: 8px; border: 1px solid #000; background: #fbfbfb; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">2. Hardware vs. Software</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"><p><br/>
A good way to think about a computer is to compare it to a cooking
scenario. The computer's hardware is like the kitchen with all its
equipment (oven, fridge, utensils), and the program (software) is like
the recipe that tells the cook (CPU) what to do with that equipment. The
<strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</strong> is the master chef of the
computer that executes instructions one by one. It uses ingredients
stored in <strong>memory</strong> (RAM), which is like the countertop
space where you place ingredients you're actively working with. There's
also <strong>long-term storage</strong> (like a pantry or fridge - on a
computer this would be a hard drive or SSD) where data is kept for later
use. Input devices (keyboard, mouse) and output devices (monitor,
printer) are how we interact with the computer, like the ingredients
coming in and the finished dish going out.</p><p>A computer's hardware is designed to be very flexible: by loading
different programs (recipes), the same hardware can perform an
incredible range of tasks. One moment your computer can display a game;
the next, it can play music or calculate a budget, all by switching
programs. <strong>Software</strong> refers to these programs - the
sequences of instructions - that configure the hardware to do a specific
job.</p></div></details><details class="nested-toggle" style="margin-top: 8px; border: 1px solid #000; background: #fbfbfb; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">3. The Digital Realm - All Data as 0s and 1s</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"><p><br/>
Computers ultimately work in binary. Inside the electronic circuits of a
computer, everything is represented by high or low voltage (on or off).
This maps naturally to two symbols: <code>1</code> (on) and
<code>0</code> (off). Any piece of information can be broken down into a
sequence of bits (binary digits). For example, the letter
<strong>A</strong> is represented by the number <code>65</code> in one
common scheme (ASCII), which in binary is <code>1000001</code>. A simple
black-and-white image can be represented by 0s and 1s indicating white
or black pixels. Even sound is digitized into binary numbers.</p><p>Why do we care about binary in a programming class? As a programmer,
you mostly work in high-level languages (like Java), not directly with
0s and 1s. However, understanding that everything in a computer is
numbers gives you insight into how things work under the hood. For
instance, you'll eventually learn how text is encoded in binary or how
images are just a bunch of numbers. In Java, you don't have to write
binary code - the tools will translate your code into binary for the
machine - but this concept is the foundation that makes computing
possible.</p><details><summary><strong>If you're curious:
High-Level vs. Low-Level languages</strong></summary>
<p>Early computers had to be programmed in very low-level
instructions (essentially writing the binary codes or something called
assembly language which closely corresponds to binary). These were
error-prone and hard for humans to manage. Modern languages like Java
are <em>high-level</em>, which means they are closer to
human language and abstract away hardware details. One line of Java
might result in many binary instructions executed by the CPU, but we let
the compiler and runtime handle that translation. High-level languages
improve programmer productivity and portability of code between
different hardware. The tradeoff is that you rely on
compilers/interpreters to bridge the gap to the binary level.</p>

Programming is the act of creating these software instructions. Why
learn it? Because it empowers you to create solutions, automate tasks,
and understand the technology that underpins modern life. Even a little
programming knowledge can help you break down problems and think
logically. For computer science students, programming is a fundamental
skill - it's how we "talk" to computers and make them do useful
work.</p><p>There are many programming languages out there (Python, C++,
JavaScript, etc.), each with its strengths. In this course, we're
focusing on <strong>Java</strong>. Java is a popular language that has
been around for decades, used in everything from large enterprise
servers to Android phone apps. One reason to use Java is that it's
designed to be <em>portable</em> - you can write a Java program on one
system and run it on almost any other system with a Java Virtual
Machine. It's also a statically-typed language with a strict syntax,
which, while a bit verbose, helps catch errors early (at compile time).
Java is widely used in industry and has a wealth of libraries and
community support. For a beginner, Java's syntax will teach you
structured programming and object-oriented principles that apply to many
other languages. In short, learning Java will set a solid foundation for
your programming journey.</p></div></details><details class="nested-toggle" style="margin-top: 8px; border: 1px solid #000; background: #fbfbfb; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">5. The Process of Programming (Write -> Compile ->
Run)</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"><p><br/>
Writing a program is a multi-step process. Here's the typical
workflow:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>Write the Code:</strong> You start by writing your source
code in a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). In
our class, we use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with the Java extension,
which is an IDE that helps manage and run Java code. You create a file
with a <code>.java</code> extension (for example,
<code>MyProgram.java</code>). Inside that file, you'll write your
instructions using Java's syntax. Don't worry about the details of
syntax yet - we'll get to that. At this stage, think of it as writing a
recipe for the computer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compile the Code:</strong> Once you have some code
written, the next step is to <strong>compile</strong> it. The compiler
(<code>javac</code> in Java) checks your code for any syntax errors -
like a grammar checker for programming. If you missed a semicolon or
misspelled a command, the compiler will complain and give you an error
message. You'll need to fix any such errors until the compiler is happy.
If the code has no syntax errors, the compiler translates your Java
source into <strong>bytecode</strong>. Bytecode is a lower-level,
platform-independent code that ends up in a file with a
<code>.class</code> extension. For example, compiling
<code>MyProgram.java</code> produces <code>MyProgram.class</code>. This
bytecode isn't exactly human-readable, but it's what the computer
(specifically the Java Virtual Machine) will execute.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Run the Program:</strong> Now it's time to see your
program in action. You run the program by invoking the Java interpreter
(the JVM). In practice, this might mean clicking a "Run" button in your
IDE or typing <code>java MyProgram</code> in a terminal. The JVM will
load your compiled <code>.class</code> file and start executing the
instructions. If your program produces output (like text on the screen),
you'll see it now. If it interacts with a user, this is when it would,
for example, wait for input or display a window (later in the course).
Running is also where any <strong>runtime errors</strong> or logical
errors will surface (more on those in Section 1.3).</p></li>
</ul><p>Think of this process like writing and performing a play: you write
the script (source code), you have a rehearsal where you fix language
errors (compilation), and then you go on stage to perform it (running
the program).</p></div></details><details class="nested-toggle" style="margin-top: 8px; border: 1px solid #000; background: #fbfbfb; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Need to (re)install Java or VS Code?</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"><p>Follow the Getting Set for CSCD210 checklist.

A Tiny First Program</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"><p><br/>
Let's test that everything is set up correctly by writing a very simple
Java program. This program will do nothing fancy - it will just print a
message to the screen. We'll use it to verify that we can successfully
edit, compile, and run a Java program in VS Code.</p></div></details><details class="nested-toggle" style="margin-top: 8px; border: 1px solid #000; background: #fbfbfb; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Now You Try - Your First Java Program</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"><p><br/>
Open VS Code and create a new file called <code>MyComputer.java</code>.
Type the following code into the file:</p><pre><code>public class MyComputer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Computers are awesome!");
    }
}</code></pre><p>Let's break down what's in this file (we will explore all these parts
in more detail in Section 1.2, so don't worry if it's not fully clear
yet):</p><ul>
<li><code>public class MyComputer { ... }</code> - This defines a class
named MyComputer. In Java, every program lives inside a class. The class
name must match your file name (MyComputer.java) exactly, including
capitalization.</li>
<li><code>public static void main(String[] args) { ... }</code> - This
defines a method named <code>main</code>. The <code>main</code> method
is special: it's the entry point of any Java application. When you run
the program, the code inside <code>main</code> is what executes first.
The weird syntax and words (<code>public static void</code> and the
<code>String[] args</code>) can be ignored for now - just treat
<code>public static void main(String[] args)</code> as a required "magic
header" that you'll use in every program for now.</li>
<li><code>System.out.println("Computers are awesome!");</code> - This
line is inside the main method. It's a command to print the text
"Computers are awesome!" to the screen. Every statement in Java ends
with a semicolon <code>;</code>. We'll talk more about
<code>System.out.println</code> in the next section; it's the way to
produce console output.</li>
</ul><p>Save the file, and then compile/run it. In VS Code, you might simply
click the Run button. If everything is set up correctly, the program
should compile (with no errors), and you should see the message
<strong>Computers are awesome!</strong> appear in the
console/terminal.</p><p>Congratulations - you just wrote and ran your first Java program! *
It might not seem like much, but you've gone through the same steps
professionals use to build software: writing code, compiling it, and
running it to see the result.</p><p>If this didn't work (for example, if you got an error message),
double-check that you copied the code exactly, including capitalization
and punctuation. Common mistakes for first programs include: -
Misspelling <code>main</code> or <code>System</code> (Java is
case-sensitive, so <code>Main</code> or <code>system</code> will not
work). - Missing a curly brace <code>{</code> or <code>}</code> or a
semicolon <code>;</code>. - Saving the file with the wrong name
(filename must exactly match the class name).</p></div></details><details class="nested-toggle" style="margin-top: 8px; border: 1px solid #000; background: #fbfbfb; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">8. What's Next</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"><p><br/>
Now that you have a basic idea of what a program looks like and how to
run one, we'll dive deeper into Java specifics. In <strong>Section
1.2</strong>, we'll dissect the structure of a Java program (like the
one you just ran) and explore more commands for producing output, along
with rules for writing Java code. By the end of the next section, you'll
be more comfortable writing your own simple programs in Java.</p><p>Keep this in mind: every expert programmer started with their first
program just like this. From printing a single line, you'll gradually
build up to creating complex software. It all starts with understanding
these basic concepts and practicing. So, let's move on and start
learning the building blocks of Java programs!</p></div></details></div></details></section>
