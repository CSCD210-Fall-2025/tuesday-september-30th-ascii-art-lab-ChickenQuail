of errors new programmers will encounter: <strong>syntax errors</strong>
(also known as compile-time errors) and <strong>logic errors</strong>
(often called bugs). We learn what syntax errors are - violations of the
programming language's rules - and how the compiler helps identify them
with error messages. We also cover logic errors - mistakes in the
program's design that lead to incorrect behavior - which do not produce
compiler errors but result in wrong output or unintended behavior. The
concept of <strong>runtime errors</strong> (errors that crash the
program during execution) is touched upon, with an example to illustrate
that some errors only show up when you run the program (like trying to
do impossible operations or infinite loops). By the end, students should
understand that errors are a normal part of programming and know the
basic approach to finding and fixing them (a process called
<strong>debugging</strong>). We also introduce the historical origin of
the term "bug."</p></div></details><details class="nested-toggle" style="margin-top: 8px; border: 1px solid #000; background: #fbfbfb; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Key Concepts and Learning Objectives</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"><ul>

that causes it to produce incorrect results or behave unexpectedly, even
though it runs to completion. The program doesn't crash or stop; it
simply doesn't do what you intended. Example: Using the wrong formula to
convert temperatures so all outputs are wrong - the program runs, but
the output is incorrect.</div></details><details class="flashcard" style="border: 1px solid #000; background: #ffffff; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Runtime Error</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"> An error that occurs during program
execution (after successful compilation) that causes the program to
crash or hang. Examples include dividing by zero, trying to access
something that doesn't exist, or infinite recursion/loops that never

<code>ArithmeticException</code> for divide by zero) or just program
freeze.</div></details><details class="flashcard" style="border: 1px solid #000; background: #ffffff; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Exception</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"> (Optional term) A kind of runtime error
signal in Java. When something goes seriously wrong at runtime (like an

program that causes incorrect behavior. Fun fact: the term "bug" has
been used since the early days of computing; famously, in 1947 engineers
found a moth in a computer that was causing an error - they taped it in
the logbook noting it as the "first actual case of bug being found."
Since then, any glitch or error is nicknamed a bug.</div></details><details class="flashcard" style="border: 1px solid #000; background: #ffffff; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Logic vs. Syntax Error</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"> (Not a single term, but
important distinction) Syntax errors prevent the code from compiling;
logic errors compile fine but produce wrong results.</div></details></div></div></details><details class="nested-toggle" style="margin-top: 8px; border: 1px solid #000; background: #fbfbfb; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">What You Should Know by the End</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"><ul>
<li>That if your program doesn't compile, you likely have a syntax
error. You should know how to read the compiler's error output to
identify what kind of syntax error and where in your code it
happened.</li>
<li>Some common syntax errors to watch out for: missing semicolons,
missing/mismatched parentheses or braces, forgetting quotes around
strings, using a variable or method name that's not declared or is
misspelled, etc.</li>
<li>That even if your program compiles successfully, it might still have
logic errors. You need to test the program's behavior to catch
those.</li>
<li>Basic strategies to find logic errors: think through the expected
behavior, add print statements to see intermediate values or execution
flow (later you might use a debugger), and check the code logic against
what it's supposed to do.</li>
<li>Recognize a runtime error situation. For example, if your program is
stuck (non-terminating) or crashes with an exception message, that's a
runtime issue. You should have an idea that something like an infinite
loop or infinite recursion will cause a program to hang or crash (stack
overflow).</li>
<li>That debugging is a normal part of programming. You shouldn't be
discouraged by errors; instead, treat them as clues to improve your
code. Knowing the origin of the term "bug" might provide some historical
context and a bit of levity when you're fixing your own "bugs."</li>
<li>How to approach errors systematically: fix the first error message
first (because one syntax error can sometimes trigger many follow-up
errors in the compiler output), test frequently (don't write 100 lines
of code and then compile - write a little, compile, fix errors,
continue), and when output is wrong, isolate which part of the code is
responsible by checking intermediate results or using simpler
inputs.</li>

<li><p><strong>Q: The compiler reports an error "';' expected" at a
certain line. What is the likely cause, and how do you fix
it?</strong><br/></p><details><summary><strong>Show
Answer</strong></summary> <p>This message usually
means you forgot a semicolon at the end of a statement on that line (or
possibly the previous line, since the compiler noticed it when it
expected to see one). To fix it, you would add the missing
<code>;</code> at the appropriate place. Occasionally, an
earlier missing brace can also confuse the compiler to think a semicolon
is missing, but the first thing to check is that every statement ends
with <code>;</code>.</p> </details></li>
<li><p><strong>Q: A program compiles fine, but when running, it produces
an output that is clearly wrong. Is this a syntax error or a logic
error, and what should you do next?</strong><br/></p><details><summary><strong>Show
Answer</strong></summary> <p>If it compiles but the
output is wrong, it's a <strong>logic error</strong> (a bug in the
program's logic). The compiler didn't catch it because the code is
syntactically correct. Next, you should debug the program: review your
code to find where it deviates from the intended logic. You might add
print statements to check values or flow, use test cases to narrow down
the issue, and then correct the faulty logic. Essentially, ask yourself
"Why is the output wrong? What part of the code produces that output?"
and investigate there.</p> </details></li>
<li><p><strong>Q: True or False - "If a program has a logic error, the
Java compiler will display an error message to help you fix
it."</strong><br/></p><details><summary><strong>Show
Answer</strong></summary> <p>False. The Java compiler
only checks for syntax errors (and some static semantic errors). It
cannot tell if your program's logic is correct or not - if the code is
grammatically legal Java, it will compile. Logic errors are on you, the
programmer, to detect (via testing) and fix. The compiler won't directly
point them out.</p> </details></li>

Inevitably, you
have or will run into errors. <strong>Don't panic!</strong> Errors are a
normal part of programming - everyone, from beginners to experts,
encounters them. The key is learning how to interpret errors and
methodically fix them. Let's explore the two main kinds of errors.</p><details class="nested-toggle" style="margin-top: 8px; border: 1px solid #000; background: #fbfbfb; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">1. Syntax Errors - When the Code Breaks the
Rules</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"><p><br/>
A <strong>syntax error</strong> occurs when your code does not follow
the grammar rules of the Java language. In simpler terms, you typed
something that Java simply doesn't understand or that violates the
language's strict structure.</p><p>For example, consider this snippet:</p><pre><code>public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("This line is fine.")
        System.out.println("This line is missing a semicolon")
    }
}</code></pre><p>Here, the first <code>println</code> line is fine (though it has a
period in the string that's not a problem because it's inside quotes and
thus just character output). The second <code>println</code> line is
missing a semicolon at the end. This is a syntax error. If you tried to
compile this code, the compiler would likely point to the end of that
second line and say something like <code>';' expected</code> or "reached
end of file while parsing" (if it got really confused by missing
symbols).</p></div></details><details class="nested-toggle" style="margin-top: 8px; border: 1px solid #000; background: #fbfbfb; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Common causes of syntax errors</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"><p> - Missing
punctuation: forgetting semicolons at end of statements, missing commas
in lists (later when we have things like parameters or arrays), etc. -
Mismatched or missing brackets/braces: forgetting a closing
<code>}</code> or <code>)</code>. Sometimes if you open a parenthesis or
brace and never close it, the compiler might throw an error at a later
line or at end-of-file. These can be tricky - always count and match
your <code>{}</code> and <code>()</code> carefully. Your editor can help
by highlighting matches. - Misspelling identifiers or keywords: writing
<code>Println</code> instead of <code>println</code>, or
<code>Ststem</code> instead of <code>System</code>. Java is
case-sensitive and every letter matters. A misspelled keyword or class
name is essentially unrecognized text to the compiler. - Using a
variable or method that hasn't been declared: For instance, writing
<code>System.ou.println(...)</code> (missing the t in out) - the
compiler will say "Cannot find symbol ou" because <code>System.ou</code>
is not defined. - Having a string literal not properly closed: e.g.,
<code>System.out.println("Hello world);</code> (missing the ending
quote). This often leads to a cascade of weird errors because the
compiler keeps looking for the closing quote. - Incorrectly ordered or
nested statements: e.g., putting a statement outside of any method, or
defining a method inside another method (Java doesn't allow that),
etc.</p></div></details><details class="nested-toggle" style="margin-top: 8px; border: 1px solid #000; background: #fbfbfb; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Reading Compiler Error Messages</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"><p><br/>
When you compile (or when VS Code's language server parses your file),
you'll get error messages for any syntax errors. These messages
typically include: - The file name and line number where the error was
detected. - A description of the error.</p><p>Example:</p><pre><code>MyProgram.java:14: error: ';' expected
        System.out.println("Hello world!")
                                            ^</code></pre><p>This indicates in <code>MyProgram.java</code> at line 14, a
<code>;</code> is expected. The caret <code>^</code> often points to the
location in the line where the parser got confused - in this case after
the <code>"</code> where it expected a semicolon. So we know: go to line
14, add the semicolon.</p><p>Sometimes one mistake can cause multiple errors. For instance, if you
forget a <code>}</code> to close a block, the compiler might report an
error on a later line, or several errors as it tries to interpret the
rest. A good strategy is to <strong>fix the first error first</strong>
and then recompile - sometimes one fix will resolve subsequent
errors.</p></div></details><details class="nested-toggle" style="margin-top: 8px; border: 1px solid #000; background: #fbfbfb; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Now You Try - Trigger and Fix a Syntax Error</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"><p><br/>
Using one of your previous programs (say <code>MyComputer</code> or any
simple program), introduce a deliberate syntax error and see what the
compiler/IDE reports. For example: - Remove a semicolon from one of the
<code>println</code> statements. - Or remove one of the curly braces
<code>}</code> at the end of the class.</p><p>What error do you get? For a missing semicolon, you should see an
error about <code>';' expected</code>. For a missing brace, you might
see something like "expected '}'" or "reached end of file while
parsing". Now, put the semicolon or brace back and compile again - the
error should disappear. This exercise might seem trivial, but getting
comfortable with reading error messages is half the battle in debugging
syntax issues.</p></div></details><details class="nested-toggle" style="margin-top: 8px; border: 1px solid #000; background: #fbfbfb; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">2. Runtime Errors - When the Program Crashes or
Freezes</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"><p><br/>
A <strong>runtime error</strong> is an issue that doesn't surface during
compilation, but causes the program to crash or misbehave during
execution. Some runtime errors in Java result in an
<strong>exception</strong> being thrown. For example: - Dividing by zero
in an integer calculation will throw an <code>ArithmeticException</code>
at runtime. - Trying to access an array index that's out of bounds
(we'll see arrays later) throws an
<code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>. - If you have an infinite
loop or recursion, the program might not throw an exception but will
effectively hang (run forever until you stop it) or in recursion's case
eventually throw a <code>StackOverflowError</code> (as the call stack
runs out of space).</p><p>In Chapter 1, we don't have the tools yet to do many of these (no
loops or arrays yet), but one thing we can inadvertently do is create an
<strong>infinite recursive call</strong>. For instance, consider this
(don't run it, just read):</p><pre><code>public class Infinite {
    public static void oops() {
        System.out.println("Make it stop!");
        oops();  // this method calls itself with no termination condition
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        oops();
    }
}</code></pre><p>What do you think happens here? The <code>oops()</code> method prints
"Make it stop!" and then calls itself again... which prints and calls
itself again... and so on. This is an infinite recursion. If you run
this program, it will start printing "Make it stop!" repeatedly until
eventually the program crashes with a <code>StackOverflowError</code>
(because each nested call uses some stack memory and it never ends,
exhausting memory).</p><p>This is an example of a runtime error: the code compiles fine
(there's no syntax error in it), but it <em>logically</em> never ends.
The crash (StackOverflowError) is a runtime exception indicating
something went wrong during execution.</p><p>At this stage, just be aware that some errors won't be caught by the
compiler. You'll only notice them when you run the program and observe
something is wrong (like a crash or weird behavior).</p></div></details><details class="nested-toggle" style="margin-top: 8px; border: 1px solid #000; background: #fbfbfb; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">3. Logic Errors - The Sneakiest of Bugs</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"><p><br/>
A <strong>logic error</strong> (or bug) is when your program runs to
completion without crashing, but the result or behavior is incorrect.
The program did <em>something</em>, just not the right thing.</p><p>For example, say you intended to print the average of two numbers but
you accidentally wrote code to print their sum. The program will run,
but the output will be wrong according to the problem you were trying to
solve.</p><p>In the context of what we've done so far, logic errors could be: -
Printing the wrong text, perhaps due to a typo or wrong order of
statements. - Omitting a line of output that should be there, or having
an extra one that shouldn't. - Using <code>print</code> when you meant
<code>println</code> (so output formatting is off), or vice versa.</p><p>These won't cause any errors from Java's perspective - you have to
notice the problem by checking the output against what you expected.</p></div></details><details class="nested-toggle" style="margin-top: 8px; border: 1px solid #000; background: #fbfbfb; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Example - A Logic Error in Output</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"><p><br/>
Suppose we wanted to print a simple three-line poem:</p><pre><code>Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Java is fun.</code></pre><p>We write a program:</p><pre><code>public class Poem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Roses are red,");
        System.out.println("Violets are blue,");
        System.out.println("Java is fun.");
    }
}</code></pre><p>This would output exactly as intended. Now, imagine we accidentally
wrote the lines in the wrong order or with a mistake:</p><pre><code>public class Poem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Roses are red,");
        System.out.println("Java is fun.");
        System.out.println("Violets are blue,");
    }
}</code></pre><p>This compiles and runs, but the poem's lines are jumbled. This is a
logic error - the sequence is wrong. The computer did exactly what we
told it to; it's our instructions that were flawed.</p></div></details><details class="nested-toggle" style="margin-top: 8px; border: 1px solid #000; background: #fbfbfb; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Finding Logic Errors</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"><p><br/>
The primary way to catch logic errors is through
<strong>testing</strong> and careful reasoning. When you run your
program, always compare what it did versus what you intended. If there's
a discrepancy, something in your code's logic is off.</p><p>For the poem example, the wrong order is easy to see. In a more
complex program (say you were calculating a numeric result), you might
not immediately know the answer is wrong unless you have an expected
result to compare to. That's why, in development, we often create test
cases or scenarios where we know what the result should be. If the
program's output doesn't match, we know there's a bug.</p><p>When you find a logic error: - Trace through your code mentally (or
with print statements) to follow what it's doing. - Check the values of
important variables at different stages (later we'll learn about
debugging tools, but printing intermediate results is a straightforward
way). - Often, isolating the section of code responsible for producing
the wrong output and inspecting it is the way to go.</p></div></details><details class="nested-toggle" style="margin-top: 8px; border: 1px solid #000; background: #fbfbfb; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Now You Try - Inducing a Logic Error</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"><p><br/>
Let's do a quick exercise: Using the <code>DrawFigures1</code> program
from Section 1.2 (the one with the ASCII art), intentionally introduce a
logic error and observe it. - For example, change one of the output
lines slightly. Perhaps on the line that prints <code>|United|</code>,
make a typo like <code>|Untied|</code> (transposing letters). - Compile
and run the program. It will run without complaints, but look at the
output carefully. You will see <code>Untied</code> in the figure instead
of <code>United</code>. The figure might now read as "Untied States"
which is obviously not what we meant (unless we're making a cheeky
joke). - This is a logic error. Everything about the code is
syntactically fine, but the output is not what was intended.</p><p>To fix it, simply correct the string literal to
<code>"|United|"</code>. This kind of error is easy to fix once noticed,
but imagine if it were a subtle mathematical bug; it might take more
effort to track down.</p><details><summary><strong>If you're curious: The
origin of the term "bug"</strong></summary> <p>The use
of the word "bug" to describe a program error goes back many years. A
famous story involves computer science pioneer Grace Hopper. In 1947,
she was working on the Harvard Mark II computer when it malfunctioned.
Upon opening the hardware, engineers found a moth trapped in a relay,
interfering with the machine's operation. They taped the moth into the
logbook and wrote, "First actual case of bug being found." From then on,
the process of removing errors became known as "debugging." While most
of our bugs today are human-made mistakes in code (not literal insects
in the machine), the term stuck as a fun piece of computing
lore.</p> </details></div></details><details class="nested-toggle" style="margin-top: 8px; border: 1px solid #000; background: #fbfbfb; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">4. Debugging Mindset</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"><p><br/>
When confronted with an error: - <strong>Stay calm.</strong> It's easy
to get frustrated, but try to approach it like a puzzle. - <strong>Read
the error message (if there is one).</strong> For syntax errors, the
message is your starting clue. For logic errors, you have to rely on the
discrepancy between expected and actual behavior. - <strong>Isolate the
problem.</strong> If it's a syntax error, often it's a small typo or
missing character. If it's a logic error, figure out which part of your
program is producing the wrong behavior or output. - <strong>Make one
change at a time.</strong> Don't randomly change many things hoping it
fixes the issue. Have a hypothesis: "I think the error is because I did
X. I will try changing X to Y." Then test again. - <strong>Use tools and
techniques.</strong> We mentioned inserting print statements to see
what's going on - that's a simple but powerful technique. As programs
get more complex, you might use a debugger to step through code or
inspect variables, but print debugging works in many cases. -
<strong>Ask for help if stuck.</strong> Sometimes another set of eyes (a
classmate, instructor, or even just taking a break and coming back
later) helps find something you overlooked.</p><p>Remember, each time you debug, you're learning. You'll start to
internalize common mistakes (for example, you'll learn to spot missing
semicolons almost subconsciously, or you'll remember to check your loop
conditions to avoid infinite loops, etc.). Even expert developers spend
a lot of time debugging - it's not a sign that you're a "bad"
programmer. Writing, running, and debugging code is an iterative
process. As you practice, you'll get more efficient at it and even start
writing code in ways that preempt some errors.</p></div></details><details class="nested-toggle" style="margin-top: 8px; border: 1px solid #000; background: #fbfbfb; padding: 8px;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Summary of Section 1.3</summary><div style="margin-top: 6px;"><ul>
<li><strong>Syntax errors</strong> are usually easy to fix once
identified - the compiler tells you where and what (to some extent) the
issue is. Always fix these first. - <strong>Logic errors</strong>
require careful thought - the program runs, so the only clue is "the
output/result is wrong." You have to compare what you wanted vs. what
you got and deduce where the code diverged from your intention. -
<strong>Debugging</strong> is a skill. It improves with practice. Don't
be afraid of errors; each error message or faulty output is guiding you
toward the solution.</li>
</ul><p>As we move on, we'll be writing bigger programs (with multiple
methods, starting in Section 1.4). That means more places for mistakes
to hide, but also new tools to manage complexity. Keep the lessons from
this section in mind: test your programs often, and tackle errors step
by step. Now, onward to making our programs better structured!</p></div></details></div></details></section>
